# A Decade of Crime in Toronto: Trends, Challenges and Responses (2014-2024)

## Overview

This repository provides an overview of the crime reported in Toronto between years 2014 and 2024. Using data of reported crime collected by opendatatoronto, we analyze the crime type and crime target under different districts of Toronto between 2014 and 2024. Our finding reveals that the crime types shift around time, with a marked rise in property-related crimes within ten years. These insights can help shape a comprehensive understanding of crime dynamics in Toronto during the 2014-2024 period and contribute to discussions on improving public safety and crime prevention strategies.
